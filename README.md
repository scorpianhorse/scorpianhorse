- 👋 Hi, I’m @scorpianhorse
- 👀 I’m interested in ...combining a website and database (complex - with multiple drop down boxes and connected sub-boxes). I'm not sure which is the best software to use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... the website and database or advice on which is the best to use. This is a private venture for education use in connecting 
Long Term Plans (LTP), Schemes of Work (SoW), Lesson Plans (LP) and Week Ahead. It should be able to allow for logins and donations eventually, printing, pdf, save.

- 📫 How to reach me ...kneslmark@gmail.com
